This project focuses on the visualization and analysis of gas emissions over the United Arab Emirates using remote sensing data from the Sentinel-5P satelliteâ€™s TROPOMI sensor. The system was developed using Google Earth Engine (GEE) for data processing and analysis, along with Flask for backend integration. The project provides interactive visualizations, including time series charts and mean images, allowing users to explore gas concentration trends over time.
